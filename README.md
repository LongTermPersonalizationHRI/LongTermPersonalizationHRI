## Welcome to the website

The “Personalization in Long-Term Human-Robot Interaction” workshop focuses on studies
on adaptivity to users, context, environment, and tasks in long-term interactions in a variety of
fields (e.g. companion robots, collaborative tasks, education, rehabilitation, elderly care). We
intend to create a medium for researchers to share their work in progress, to introduce their
preliminary results, and to share and discuss with the other researchers a
