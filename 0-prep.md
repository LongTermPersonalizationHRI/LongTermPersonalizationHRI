## Organizers

- Bahar Irfan, University of Plymouth, UK, bahar.irfan@plymouth.ac.uk. Bahar Irfan is an EarlyStage
Researcher and a PhD candidate at the Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems, University
of Plymouth and SoftBank Robotics Europe, Paris, France, in the joint Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie
ITN project APRIL. Her work focuses on multi-modal person recognition and personalization in
long-term HRI for conversational agents. She is also working in a joint project on socially assistive
robotics with Colombian School of Engineering Julio Garavito jointly funded by the Royal
Academy of Engineering.

- Aditi Ramachandran, Yale University, USA, aditi.ramachandran@yale.edu. Aditi Ramachandran
is a sixth year PhD candidate in the Social Robotics Lab at Yale University. Her research
focuses on personalized social robots in education.
- Samuel Spaulding, MIT Media Lab, USA, samuelsp@media.mit.edu. Samuel Spaulding is a PhD
student in the Personal Robots Group at the MIT Media Lab. His thesis research is focusing on
building robots that can learn personalized cognitive and affective models of users over repeated
interactions across different tasks.
- Dylan F. Glas, Futurewei Technologies, Huawei, USA, dylan.f.glas@gmail.com. Dylan Glas is a
Senior Robotics Software Architect at Futurewei. His research interests include interaction design
frameworks, autonomous behavior generation, and learning by imitation for social robots.
- Iolanda Leite, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden, iolanda@kth.se. Iolanda Leite is
an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at KTH. Her
research interests are in the areas of Human-Robot Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. She aims
to develop autonomous socially intelligent robots that can assist people over long periods of time.
- Kheng Lee Koay, University of Hertfordshire, UK, k.l.koay@herts.ac.uk. Kheng Lee Koay joined
the University of Hertfordshire as a Senior Research Fellow with the Adaptive Systems Research
Group in 2003, and has been a Senior Lecturer since 2016. His research expertise includes Mobile
Robotics, Robotic Home Companions, Human-Robot Interaction and Human-Robot Proxemics.
In particular, his research focuses on human centred socially acceptable human-robot interactions,
and experimental design and evaluation methodologies. He has successfully conducted a large
number of short-term and long-term HRI experimental user studies in the area of robotic home
companions, which are designed to interact with and operate safely in domestic environments.
