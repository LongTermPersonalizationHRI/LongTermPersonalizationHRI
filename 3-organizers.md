Iolanda Leite is an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at KTH. Her research interests are in the areas of Human-Robot Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. She aims to develop autonomous socially intelligent robots that can assist people over long periods of time.

- [Kheng Lee Koay](http://homepages.herts.ac.uk/~comrklk/), *University of Hertfordshire, UK*
{% include figure.html img="kheng-lee-koay.png" alt="Kheng Lee Koay" width="200px" height="200px" %}
Kheng Lee Koay joined the University of Hertfordshire as a Senior Research Fellow with the Adaptive Systems Research Group in 2003, and has been a Senior Lecturer since 2016. His research expertise includes Mobile Robotics, Robotic Home Companions, Human-Robot Interaction and Human-Robot Proxemics. In particular, his research focuses on human centred socially acceptable human-robot interactions, and experimental design and evaluation methodologies. He has successfully conducted a large number of short-term and long-term HRI experimental user studies in the area of robotic home companions, which are designed to interact with and operate safely in domestic environments.
