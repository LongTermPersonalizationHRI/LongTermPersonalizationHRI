 - Notification of acceptance: Feb 18th, 2019

 - Camera-ready deadline: Feb 28rd, 2019

## Submission Guidelines

We invite short papers of 2-4 pages (plus additional pages for references and appendices), including work in progress containing preliminary results, technical reports, case studies, surveys and state-of-the-art research of personal robots in a variety of fields (e.g. companion robots, education, rehabilitation, elderly care) and long-term studies in any of these fields. The short papers should consist of an abstract, introduction underlying the main research question or the motivation of the work, related work, methodology, and the (preliminary) results if any, along with a description of future work. All submissions will be peer-reviewed for their relevance, novelty and scientific and technical soundness. Accepted papers will require at least one author to be registered for and attend the workshop.

All manuscripts must be written in English and submitted electronically in PDF format via EasyChair, using IEEE format provided below. Supplementary materials (such as videos) can be uploaded or they can be provided as external links within the submission.

 - Adaptation algorithms for long-term interactions
 - User modeling
 - Long-term memory (episodic, semantic, associative)
 - User recognition
 - Long-term HRI studies
 - Conversational agents in long-term interactions
 - Engagement in long-term HRI
 - Evaluation in long-term HRI
 - Challenges/Guidelines for field studies in long-term HRI
 - Design and methodologies for repeated human-robot interactions
 - Autonomy in long-term interaction
